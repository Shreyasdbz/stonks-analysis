Alright children.  I'm tired of all the shitty content (duh, what happened to my shares I don't understand reverse splits, where are my dividends?, what do I do with $12?) so I thought, fuck it, be the change you want to see right?

So I'm here to add some actual fucking content. As a high school economics teacher I might be able to dumb this down enough to help a few of you.

* This is gambling/fun money.  If you're looking to prepare for real life, get a real brokerage account and buy and hold.  Robinhood is your side girl.
* Trade the same companies for months on end.  Get to know them and their market. DD's are your friend.  Don't jump on a position because some moron made a tendies to the moon post
* Get into options, but don't do anything more complex than buying calls/puts.  If you're here, you're not smart enough for strangles/straddles/condors/etc. YOU WILL FUCK IT UP!
* Don't be greedy.  YOU WILL NOT MAKE $7,000 on a $400 position.  Don't fucking HODL. Sure, it's happened before, but not to you, and it won't.
* You haven't made money unless you've exited your position.

So, how did I get here?

* Buy calls (or puts if you're dirty).  Immediately set a limit sell for 40% profit.  Don't be a fucking pig.
* If your positions go down, you have 3 choices -
   * 1.**buy more**.  See my screenshot up there? See that buying power? Keep some god damn cash.  If you liked your position at the initial price and you know the company is worth it, take the god damn discount and then reenter your sell order
   * 2. **exit the position.** Sell for a loss and keep some of your money.  I'm more of an option 1 or 3 guy.  I can't help you here
   * 3. **hold and watch it expire worthless**.  Sometimes you get lucky and your positions come back to life.  Sometimes you watch your money disappear.  See my dip 3 months ago? I got cute and went after a big money call on Amazon and rode it into the fucking dirt.  But you know what? I was still up over 1000% because I'm patient and I don't take YOLO positions.

Good luck assholes.

&#x200B;

EDIT(s):

Obligatory thanks for the gold.  None of that donate it to charity shit here, if you make money continue to send it my way.

A serious note at the end here, what works for me might not work for you but the quality of the posts in this sub is just stupid.  The number of people asking questions that are answered by simply reading the app's instructions or a quick google is mind blowing.

I thought if I posted some legit advice here it might help a few people make some actual money.

The screenshot is real and it's almost 2 years of active trading.

"-$27,746.51 because of TSLA debit spread",852,iq8gfh,https://www.reddit.com/r/RobinHood/comments/iq8gfh/2774651_because_of_tsla_debit_spread/,357,1599789268.0,"UPDATE: One of RH's brokers contacted me via phone call and told me why my balance is negative and how it happened (Basically word by word what Michael Burry Scott said in comments). He also stated vaguely that they request the money to be paid back ASAP; he did not give a time frame nor a minimum amount. He seemed very friendly and was willing to explain and hear me out (before the phone call was cut short...) I want to remind everyone to **PLEASE BE CAREFUL!!**

I owe RH cause my 5 contracts of $411/$412 Call 9/4 was exercised on 9/4 after hours at 9:13pm, but the short leg didn't close until next market day. Basically, I was forced to buy 500 shares at $411 ($205,500), RH didn't exercise the short position until Tuesday when TSLA dropped to $355 ($177,753.49).

Difference: $27,746.51.

TSLA on 9/4 closed at $418, which is ITM, so I technically was at profit, but the stock dipped after hours. So I guess RH's ""risk checks designed to close positions which accounts cannot support"" couldn't process what happened.

EDIT: I realize and understand that me losing this large sum is solely my fault and not Robinhood. I should have closed the spread before market close and I can't do anything but stop gambling in the market and make back money in other, safer ways."
